# best-ai-prompts

My personal go to is the "prompt-engineer" which I often pair with the "general-base-prompt".

As of today (and this'll probably change by next week haha), I find Gemini 2.5 Pro to be the best for coming up with a detailed plan. After that, Gemini 2.5 Pro or Claude 4 Sonnet in Cursor usually gets the job done.

Increased my producitivity like 50% cause now I can one-shot almost any problem I run into. Hopefully you can too!
